# Block Setup

This block is designed to be used with Segment data collected through the client-side Javascript library, Analytics.js. After some quick setup you'll be able to see daily, weekly, and monthly active visitors to your site and/or blog, frequency of engagement with your content, and retention of content visitors.

1. Enter your Segment schema name into the [manifest](/projects/dau_content/files/manifest.lkml).
2. Open the Content Engagement Dashboard to see examples of what can be done with this block.
3. Explore your data in the [Content Engagement - Daily Visitors explore](/explore/content_engagement/daily_visitors).
